# This dataset is a famous dataset put together by statistician/biologist Roald Fisher in 1936. It is also known as the "Iris dataset" as it contains data on three different Iris flower species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
# Each of these flower species features 50 individual data points or samples. These data points are measuring one of four features of each Iris flower - The width of the petals, the width of the sepals, the length of the petals, and the length of the sepals.
